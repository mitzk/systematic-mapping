# Systematic Mapping
This repository contains the dataset used in a study of authors in the software architecture community. These bibliographic data were retrieved from Engineering Village in Dec 2016. For research purposes, we inferred the gender of these authors using assorted tools and methods. Preliminary results about this study were presented to attendees of the 1st Women in Software Architecture track at the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA). The complete study report, describing the research protocol and findings, was submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software and is currently under review.
